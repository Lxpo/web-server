# A simple web server
# Project Name

## 📌 Overview
A simple web server made with Python. 
My goal is to learn more about Python and to get a good grasp of web servers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python

## 🚀 Features
- In Progress...

## 📚 Learning & Insights
python's http server library automatically serves the index.html file if available in the current directory.
Knowing this helped me solve the issue i encountered when it was not displaying.

## 🐞 Issues & Challenges
- **Issue:** HTML file was not being served
- **Cause:** 
    My terminal was pointing to the directory of my renamed directory. 
    I had to create an empty folder to clone my repo for this project.
    Thinking it would automatically update after opening a new window 
    I immediately ran my server and did not see the HTML file being served when visitng localhost:8000
- **Solution:** 
    Went to terminal and ran the ls command. 
    Saw that index.html was not found. 
    cd.. into parent directory and into the renamed folder.
